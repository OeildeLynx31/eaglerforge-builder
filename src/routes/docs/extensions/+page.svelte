<h1>Custom Extensions</h1>
<p>Custom extensions are a way for you to add new blocks to EaglerBuilder using JavaScript.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we will describe how to build custom extensions. The pages can be navigated using the sidebar or links at the bottom of each page. We assume that you read each page in full and do the exercises listed (if any) before going to the next page.</p>
<h1>Prerequisites</h1>
<p>Custom extension development requires knowledge of writing JavaScript. If you aren't familiar with JavaScript, please learn it first. Your favorite search engine can help you find places to learn. If you don't know things like the difference between <code>"1"</code> and <code>1</code>, developing extensions will be very difficult. As volunteers, we don't have a lot of time to spend helping you learn JavaScript -- sorry.</p>
<p>We assume that you have access to the developer tools built in to your browser or the desktop app. Typically this is accessible through right click > inspect element. In the desktop app, it can be shown with Ctrl+Shift+I (Option+Command+I on macOS). Writing JavaScript without access to the developer tools is extremely painful and not something we can provide help for.</p>
<h1>Tutorial structure</h1>
<p>This tutorial is follows a fundamentals-up approach. We're going to start with the most basic extensions imaginable that are effectively useless and gradually build up to things that are more useful.</p>
<p>We know that some of you will be eager to start sharing your extensions around, but <strong>we ask that you read through this whole tutorial before publishing your extensions</strong> so that the extensions you share are actually useful.</p>
